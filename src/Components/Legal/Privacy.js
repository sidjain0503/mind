                When you access and register for the Application, Website, YouTube Channel, Services, or Products, we get the information you give us. You typically provide the following information when you register with us: (a) your name, age, email address, location, phone number, password, and your educational interests; (b) transaction-related information, such as when you make purchases, respond to offers, or download or use applications from us; (c) Information you give us when you contact us for assistance; (d) Information you submit into our system while utilising the application, website, YouTube channel, services, or products, such as when answering questions, taking quizzes, or participating in discussions. Personal Information, Sensitive Personal Information, and Associated Information are three categories for the information that was allegedly collected from users.
                Personal information, sensitive personal information, and associated information will all collectively be referred to as "information" in this policy. Each of these terms is defined individually under the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (the "Data Protection Rules"). We may use the information to get in touch with you occasionally, provide you with services, important information, necessary notices, and marketing promotions. Your personal information will be used by us to deliver, analyse, administer, and improve our services, to personalise your visit to our Website, to communicate with you about your account and our services, to deliver personalised marketing to you, and to spot, stop, mitigate, and look into fraudulent or illegal activity.
                We also use your personal information to identify your general location, deliver localised courses and classes, give you personalised study aids and recommendations, identify your Internet service provider, respond to your questions and requests quickly and effectively, enforce our terms, and communicate with you about our service (for example, through email, push notifications, text messages, and online messaging channels).

                To carry out tasks on our behalf or to help us with the provision of services to you, we work with other businesses, agencies, or contractors (collectively, "Service Providers"). In order to personalise and optimise our service, handle credit card transactions or other forms of payment, provide customer assistance, collect debts, analyse and improve data, process and administer consumer surveys, and more, we work with service providers. These Service Providers might have access to your personal or other information while providing these services. We only give them permission to use and disclose your information in conjunction with performing their services.
                We will use Your Personal Information to carry out our commitments to You, to interact with You, to secure the Platform and make changes, and to guarantee that services related to the Platform are provided to You in the most efficient way possible. The aforementioned contact may take the form of calls, texts, or emails and may be made for transactional, service-related, or promotional objectives. You have the option to opt out of receiving communications from our end at any time by writing to us.
