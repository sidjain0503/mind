I used to be so much confused about which topics to cover first and from where to practice questions and how much time to devote to each chapter. She helps me in every possible way emotionally or be it academic. It was very difficult for me to be consistent in this time of covid. Every time I was unable to crack any question and feel depressed, she consoled me, motivated me to practice more a. I believe it was my right decision to take this mentorship program. Everyone should take this mentorship program for systematic and structured study.",

        "review":" My name is SAURAV. It's been more than 50 days since I joined the mentorship program, and it helped me focus on my single target exam, JEE Advanced. At first, I was confused about my plans, what to study, what to skip. Prepare extra for other exams or not, but since I joined mentorship, I have focused on exact points to be covered for the exam and saved a lot of time from being distracted on non-important topics and exams. I am continuously working on the portions decided by Divyansh bhaiya, and I am looking forward to achieving a good rank in JEE",
